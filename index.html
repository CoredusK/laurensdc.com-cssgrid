                <h2>Bio</h2>
                <p>
                    Interest is a quality independent of the subject. <br>
                    In life, I've been going in different directions. I've studied philosophy and nursing, but did not finish these.
                <p>
                    I decided to get a <a href="http://pretland.be/" target="_blank">job</a> with occasional headaches.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the time was nigh and the bank account existant, I decided to <a href="http://blog.laurensdc.com/contemplatons-of-an-arrival-in-nepal/" target="_blank">travel</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Meeting locals and travelers, seeing <a href="https://www.google.be/search?q=nepal+scenery&num=30&newwindow=1&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj-xYndtZTMAhWKthQKHaQGDgsQ_AUIBygB&biw=1920&bih=890" target="_blank">incredible natural sceneries</a>, doing a 14-day trek as well as several smaller ones, gathering experiences, and so much more. The trip was quite worth it. In fact, it was so worth it that I would <a href="http://blog.laurensdc.com/mumbai-airport/" target="_blank">do it again</a> the year after.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is during this travel that I discovered that I was given many opportunities that others were not. <br>
                    I found the perfect education out of nowhere, and decided to get back to studying. <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    And here we are. Webdeveloping, playing guitar, learning new stuff anywhere I can! Exciting!
